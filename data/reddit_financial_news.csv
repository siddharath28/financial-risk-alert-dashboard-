- I work in the construction industry, which tends to feel the effects of a downturn early. Lately, we've noticed a slowdown in project volume: cancelled projects, fewer new builds, and delayed starts.

StockMarket,Buffett: This year's stock market turmoil 'is really nothing',"For Warren Buffett, this year's volatility has been nothing to write home about.

""What has happened in the last 30, 45 days, 100 days, whenever you want to pick, whatever this period has been, is really nothing,"" Buffett said at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting on Saturday. ""This has not been a dramatic bear market or anything [of] the sort.""

[…]

And if the world changing is something that makes you change what your goals are as an investor, Buffett added, then it's time to get a new slant.

""If it makes a difference to you whether your stocks are down 15% or not, you need to get a somewhat different investment philosophy,"" the Oracle of Omaha said. ""The world is not going to adapt to you. You're going to have to adapt to the world.""

StockMarket,"US Has Reached Out to China to Initiate Tariff Talks, CCTV Says","(Bloomberg) — US President Donald Trump’s administration has been seeking contact with Beijing to initiate talks on the massive tariffs Washington has imposed on China, according to a state-run media outlet.

The US government recently reached out to China though various channels, Yuyuantantian, a Weibo account affiliated with China Central Television that regularly signals Beijing’s views on trade, said in a post. It cited unidentified people with knowledge of the matter, providing no further details.

The post casts a different light on behind-the-scenes maneuvering between the world’s two largest economies. Trump has repeatedly said President Xi Jinping needs to contact him in order to begin tariff talks and earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it’s up to Beijing to take the first step to de-escalate the dispute.

Trump argued Wednesday during a Cabinet meeting that a recent fall in cargo flows indicated that Beijing would soon need to engage with him. The president said he was “not happy” with the sharp decline in trade between the two nations because he wanted “China to do well” while treating the US fairly.

Trump later Wednesday expressed confidence he would eventually speak with Xi, despite the Chinese leader’s reluctance to engage directly with his counterpart. “It’ll happen,” Trump said.

“China doesn’t need to talk to the US until it takes meaningful measures,” Yuyuantantian said in the post. From a negotiation standpoint, the US is “clearly the more anxious party at the moment,” it added, citing pressure the Trump administration faces on multiple fronts.

In Washington, official data showed the US economy contracted at the start of the year for the first time since 2022 following a monumental pre-tariffs import surge and more moderate consumer spending. The data provided a first snapshot of ripple effects from Trump’s trade policies.

At the same time, prices from some of the most popular sellers of made-in-China goods already suggest US shoppers will be paying a major portion of the bill despite Trump’s claim Beijing will bear the brunt of his 145% tariffs.

StockMarket,"People keep asking for proof that he said this, but since I can't edit a post here once I post it, here's the video in a new post.","Some of this is worse than the quote, because he saying that Chinese factories are all sitting empty because America is their only customer.

While I'm sure that there are some factories like that, the story in the media has changed.  Earlier we were hearing claims that America buys more than half of China's output.

The number I'm seeing now is that exports to the US were 2.9% of their GDP in 2024.  So, yeah, that earlier rumor was bullshit.

And China is a dictatorship, so if their leader wants to do something painful, he can get away with it.

And taking America's place among our allies who Trump has all insulted and betrayed is too good a deal to pass up.  And so stiffing Trump is good international politics, and probably good domestic anyway.

I hear that Trump is popular among a lot of Chinese people because they believe that he's destroying the US.  So at least SOME people like him.

The partial quote I copied last time was 

>They made a trillion dollars with Biden selling us stuff. Much of it we don't need. Somebody said ""oh, the shelves are gonna be open.""  Well maybe the children will have 2 dolls instead of 30 doll, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more.

>

The CEOs of Walmart and Target warned him that they're about to have empty shelves and all they got was Trump mocking them with ""Somebody said 'oh the shelves are gonna be open.""

""Somebody said""

In effect he is willing to rule over a much poorer country in order to never have been wrong.

I don't think he has a choice, *he can’t accept himself being wrong or mistaken the same way a healthy person without narcissism can.* He’ll take any and every whacky explanation available for why he’s not wrong, and on some level I think he believes it.

For maybe 40 years he's been getting audiences angry with his rant that trade imbalances are the same as being cheated out of all of your money.  It's based on a complete misunderstanding, a stupid one.  But as a narcissist, it is emotionally impossible for it not to be true.

StockMarket,BREAKING News: US and Ukraine sign minerals deal that solidifies investment in Kyiv’s defense against Russia,"The US and Kyiv have signed an agreement to share profits and royalties from the future sale of Ukrainian minerals and rare earths, sealing a deal that Donald Trump has said will provide an economic incentive for the US to continue to invest in Ukraine’s defense and its reconstruction after he brokers a peace deal with Russia.

The minerals deal, which has been the subject of tense negotiations for months and nearly fell through hours before it was signed, will establish a US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund that the Trump administration has said will begin to repay an estimated $175bn in aid provided to Ukraine since the beginning of the war.

“This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,” said Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, in a statement.

“President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides’ commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine. And to be clear, no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine.”

Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, confirmed in a social media post that she had signed the agreement on Wednesday. “Together with the United States, we are creating the fund that will attract global investment into our country,” she wrote. The deal still needs to be approved by Ukraine’s parliament.

Ukrainian officials have divulged details of the agreement which they portrayed as equitable and allowing Ukraine to maintain control over its natural resources.

The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said that the fund would be split 50-50 with between the US and Ukraine and give each side equal voting rights.

Ukraine would retain “full control over its mineral resources, infrastructure and natural resources,” he said, and would relate only to new investments, meaning that the deal would not provide for any debt obligations against Ukraine, a key concern for Kyiv. The deal would ensure revenue by establishing contracts on a “take-or-pay” basis, Shmyhal added.

Shmyhal on Wednesday described the deal as “truly a good, equal and beneficial international agreement on joint investments in the development and recovery of Ukraine”.

Critics of the deal had said the White House is seeking to take advantage of Ukraine by linking future aid to the embattled nation to a giveaway of the revenues from its resources. The final terms were far less onerous for Ukraine than those proposed initially by Bessent in February, which included a clause that the US would control 100% of the revenues from the fund.

It was unclear up until the last moment whether the US and Ukraine would manage to sign the deal, with Washington reportedly pressuring Ukraine to sign additional agreements, including on the structure of the investment fund, or to “go back home”. That followed months of strained negotiations during which the US regularly delivered last-minute ultimatums while cutting off aid and other support for Ukraine in its defence against Russia.

Ukraine’s prime minister earlier had said he expected the country to sign the minerals deal with the US in “the next 24 hours” but reports emerged that Washington was insisting Kyiv sign three deals in total.

The Financial Times said Bessent’s team had told Svyrydenko, who was reportedly en route to Washington DC, to “be ready to sign all agreements, or go back home”.

Bessent later said the US was ready to sign though Ukraine had made some last-minute changes.

Reuters reported that Ukraine believed the two supplementary agreements – reportedly on an investment fund and a technical document – required more work.

The idea behind the deal was originally proposed by Ukraine, looking for ways to offer economic opportunities that might entice Trump to back the country. But Kyiv was blindsided in January when Trump’s team delivered a document that would essentially involve handing over the country’s mineral wealth with little by way of return.

Since then, there have been various attempts to revise and revisit the terms of the deal, as well as a planned signing ceremony that was aborted after a disastrous meeting between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in February.

Earlier this month, it was revealed that the Ukrainian justice ministry had hired US law firm Hogan Lovells to advise on the negotiations over the deal, according to filings with the US Foreign Agents Registration Act registry.

In a post on Facebook, Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko gave further details of the fund, which she said would “attract global investment”.

She confirmed that Ukraine would retain full ownership of resources “on our territory and in territorial waters belong to Ukraine”. “It is the Ukrainian state that determines where and what to extract,” she said.

There would be no changes to ownership of state-owned companies, she said, “they will continue to belong to Ukraine”. That included companies such as Ukrnafta, Ukraine’s largest oil producer, and nuclear energy producer Energoatom.

Income would come from new licences for critical materials and oil and gas projects, not from projects which had already begun, she said.

Income and contributions to the fund would not be taxed in the US or Ukraine, she said, “to make investments yield the greatest results”.

Razom for Ukraine, a US nonprofit that provides medical and humanitarian aid to Ukraine and advocates for US assistance, welcomed the deal, and encouraged the Trump administration to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin to end the invasion. “We encourage the Trump administration to build on the momentum of this economic agreement by forcing Putin to the table through sanctions, seizing Russia’s state assets to aid Ukraine, and giving Ukraine the tools it needs to defend itself,” Mykola Murskyj, director of advocacy for Razom, said in a statement.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/30/us-ukraine-minerals-deal-russia,2025-05-01 00:36:46,Reddit

StockMarket,Trump Threatens New Sanctions on China Over Iranian Oil — So Much for a Deal,"

So much for de-escalation.

Earlier today, President Trump posted a blunt threat on Truth Social: “ALL purchases of Iranian oil or petrochemical products must stop, NOW!” He warned that any country or person buying “ANY AMOUNT” from Iran would face secondary sanctions, meaning they’d be cut off from doing business with the U.S.

The White House didn’t name names, but let’s be honest — this is aimed directly at China, which the State Department recently acknowledged is “by far” the largest buyer of Iranian oil.



What This Means:
	1.	There is no China deal coming. Period.
These sanctions run completely counter to any form of trade de-escalation. You don’t threaten your negotiating partner with economic exile and expect a handshake next week.
	2.	U.S.–China tension just leveled up.
We’re no longer talking about tariffs on phones or laptops. Now it’s energy — the backbone of China’s industrial machine. Trump just crossed a red line.
	3.	Markets are mispricing risk.
Futures may be green today, but this is not bullish news. If sanctions go into effect, expect retaliation from Beijing and a renewed drag on global trade.



Trump isn’t bluffing — and if you thought we were inching toward a truce with China, think again. This just nuked that narrative.

StockMarket,The Fed is in a dilemma.,"The current facts:
- Inflation could be high in April (we'll find out how high next week)
- The USD is devaluating
- The economy is on a slowdown
- The US has a very high federal debt and will pay around 1 trillion dollars in interest alone this year
- We are approaching 7.4 trillion dollars of debt that need to be refinanced in 12 months

So what should the Fed do? On one hand, raising rates will slow down the economy and increase debt and interest payments, but at least it will help with inflation and USD devaluation.

On the other hand, lowering rates will increase inflation and devalue the USD. But it will make US federal debt more manageable and help the economy by making loans cheaper.

So what should he do? Both will cause side effects that will hurt the consumer in the end. Can a recession be prevented at this stage?",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kg2y8v/the_fed_is_in_a_dilemma/,2025-05-06 12:14:42,Reddit

StockMarket,"Tesla sees steep sales drops in April across Europe: 81% in Sweden, 75% in Netherlands, 67% in Denmark, and 59% in France","Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA), [Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) is [feeling the chill in Europe](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/france-car-registrations-down-564-april-tesla-sales-drop-5945-2025-05-01/). Its April sales plummeted across key markets like France and Denmark, as political controversy and growing competition weigh on the brand.

In France, Tesla sold just 863 vehicles last month a 59.4% year-over-year drop and its fourth straight monthly decline. Sales in Denmark were even worse, falling 67.2% to only 180 vehicles.

Year-to-date, Tesla's France sales are down nearly 44%, compared to a 7.3% dip in the overall market.

It's not just about cars anymore. Tesla's limited model lineup is facing heat from new and cheaper electric vehicles especially from Chinese brands. But it's CEO Elon Musk's politics that may be burning hotter.

His outspoken support of President Trump has sparked protests across Europe, including vandalism at Tesla showrooms and charging stations. Many consumers appear to be voting with their wallets.

Tesla's European slump adds to a rough quarter. In Q1, the company's auto revenue dropped 20%, and net income plunged 71%, both missing expectations. April's data suggests the pain may continue into Q2.

More European data is expected soon, but for now, the signs point to a rocky road ahead especially if brand perception continues to slide.

At the same time, relevant U.S. parties have recently and proactively conveyed messages to China, hoping to engage in talks. China is currently assessing the situation.  
  
China’s position remains consistent: if it’s a fight, we’ll see it through to the end; if it’s a talk, the door is open. The tariff and trade war was unilaterally initiated by the U.S. If the U.S. wants to talk, it should demonstrate genuine sincerity — by correcting its wrongful actions and being prepared to remove the unilateral tariff increases. We have noted that the U.S. has recently been sending signals about adjusting its tariff measures.  
  
China would like to emphasize: in any potential dialogue or negotiations, if the U.S. does not correct its erroneous unilateral tariff measures, it will show a complete lack of sincerity and will further damage mutual trust. Saying one thing and doing another, or trying to use talks as a cover for coercion and blackmail — that will not work with China.

StockMarket,"Trump downplays recession fears, saying the U.S. would be 'OK' in the long term","President Donald Trump on Friday downplayed concerns about potential economic trouble, saying everything would be “OK” in the long term, even if the U.S economy experienced a recession in the short term.

Asked twice by “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker whether it would be OK in the long run if there were a recession in the short term, the president said, “Look, yeah, it’s — everything’s OK. What we are — I said, this is a transition period. I think we’re going to do fantastically.”

Following up, Welker asked Trump if he was worried about a recession, to which he responded, “No.” Asked whether he thinks one could happen, Trump replied, “Anything can happen, but I think we’re going to have the greatest economy in the history of our country.”

The remarks come as analysts on Wall Street [are increasingly worried](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/wednesdays-q1-gdp-report-added-to-fears-us-is-already-in-a-recession.html) that the country could face a recession due to Trump’s changing tariff policy.

“Well, you know, you say, ‘Some people on Wall Street say’ — well, I tell you something else. Some people on Wall Street say that we’re going to have the greatest economy in history. Why don’t you talk about them?” Trump said during the interview at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

“There are many people on Wall Street say this is going to be the greatest windfall ever happen,” the president added.

According to initial measurements released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday, the U.S. economy [shr](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/gdp-q1-us-economy-contracts-rcna203608)[a](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/gdp-q1-us-economy-contracts-rcna203608)[nk by 0.3%](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/gdp-q1-us-economy-contracts-rcna203608) in the first quarter of 2025, a reduction largely driven by a fall in exports and a boost in imports ahead of Trump’s expected tariffs.

On Wednesday, while meeting with members of his Cabinet, Trump deflected blame for the first-quarter gross domestic product numbers, saying they were a result of the economy former President Joe Biden left behind.

“You probably saw some numbers today,” Trump said, “and I have to start off by saying, that’s Biden.”

“That’s not Trump,” he added Wednesday. “Because we came in on January, these are quarterly numbers, and we came in and I was very against everything that Biden was doing in terms of the economy, destroying our country in so many ways.”

Since the start of his administration in January, Trump has sought to impose tariffs on America’s largest trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and China.

Early last month, the president [paused](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-tariffs-president-announces-90-day-pause-what-to-know-rcna200463) the introduction of larger tariffs on most countries for 90 days, just days after imposing them. His partial retreat fueled a rally in markets, which as of Friday recovered the losses they suffered after his initial tariff announcement on April 2.

At the same time, Trump slapped even more tariffs on China, raising the tariff rate on the Asian nation to 145%.

Still, the president has repeatedly dismissed concerns that the tariffs on China will have major effects on the prices or availability of consumer goods in the U.S.

During the Cabinet meeting, he told reporters, “Somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are going to be open.’ Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.”

StockMarket,Manufacturing activity hits 5-month low as Trump tariffs leave businesses in 'state of near paralysis',"US manufacturing activity slid to a five-month low in April as President [Trump's tariffs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-tariffs-live-updates-automakers-get-reprieve-as-bessent-lutnick-tout-deal-progress-191201826.html) continued to create uncertainty for businesses.

The[ Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI ](https://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/reports/ism-report-on-business/pmi/april/)fell to 48.7 in April, below the 49 seen the month prior. Readings below 50 indicate contraction in the sector.

The ISM's prices paid index for the sector came in at 69.8, roughly flat compared to the prior month. Meanwhile, new orders increased to a reading of 47.2, above the 45.2 seen in March.

""In April, U.S. manufacturing activity slipped marginally further into contraction after expanding only marginally in February,"" Institute for Supply Management chair Timothy Fiore said in a press release. ""Demand and output weakened while input strengthened further, conditions that are not considered positive for economic growth.""

The ISM release includes comments from survey respondents across various industries. Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday that nearly all of the comments ""described a state of near paralysis"" as businesses struggle to account for the changing tariff policies.

""The tone of these comments suggests that business planning is impossible for the majority of manufacturers, irrespective of their industry specialty,"" Simons wrote. ""Frankly, it is a surprise that the index levels are as high as they are. These comments are consistent with a PMI reading in the 20s or 30s.""

In a separate release on Thursday, S&P Global's manufacturing data showed activity held flat at a reading of 50.2 in April. Meanwhile, S&P Global noted that tariff impacts boosted both input and selling costs.

""It tells me that this process that started with the policy uncertainty and then moved to the markets is now starting to show up in the real data,"" S&P Global Ratings global chief economist Paul Gruenwald told Yahoo Finance. ""That's kind of the last leg of this transmission.""

Gruenwald added that the ""key variable"" for the economy moving forward will be whether or not the labor market deteriorates further.

""If you want to differentiate between the slowdown scenario and the recession scenario, it's going to center on the labor market,"" Gruenwald said. ""So if we start to see cracks in the labor market, that's going to take us into the recession scenario. Not there yet, but we're starting to see a little bit of weakness.""

New data out this week has shown further signs of cooling in the labor market. ADP reported that private payrolls grew by just 62,000 in April, the smallest increase since July 2024. Meanwhile, a separate release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics [showed](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/job-openings-fall-more-than-expected-in-march-hover-near-4-year-low-150538649.html) job openings hit a four-month low at the end of March and are hovering near their lowest level since December 2020.

On Friday, the April jobs report is expected to show 135,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month while unemployment held steady at 4.2%, according to data from Bloomberg.

In March, [the US economy added 228,000 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-adds-228000-jobs-in-march-unemployment-rate-rises-to-42-203511885.html) while the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%.

StockMarket,"Tariffs are worse than they were on ""Liberation Day""","Just wanted to throw this out there. I was curious what the effective tariff rate was after the tariff ""pause"" and escalation with China. It appears to be actually up from the initial Liberation Day tariffs due to the massive retaliatory tariffs on China.

For countries with <1% import share, I assumed they all had an equal share, which likely introduces some error. The 15% rate comes from the average across the remaining ~150 countries.

Data from the BBC here: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypxnnyg7jo

This does not include tariffs on steel or aluminum or cars, or supposedly incoming pharmaceutical tariffs. It however also doesn't include the exemptions on semiconductors and such.

Now of course, import share can shift, companies might eat costs, manufacturers might eat costs, etc.

But if the Liberation Day tariffs made you queasy and then the pause soothed you, just know that the new tariff rates actually raise prices on imports higher, due to the escalations with China and their relative share of U.S. imports.",https://i.redd.it/3c56zipzllye1.png,2025-05-03 17:02:45,Reddit

StockMarket,"New 25% auto parts tariffs took effect May 3 — automakers face billions in added costs, up to $4,000 per vehicle","The average car buyer doesn’t think about where the parts in their vehicle come from – but automakers do.

That’s why a new round of auto tariffs – this time on parts – coming into effect Saturday could upend the industry, even more than previous levies on imported cars.

As of 12:01 am ET on Saturday, most auto part imports will come with a 25% import tax.

The previous auto tariffs left US-made cars untouched. Not anymore. Not a single of the 10 million cars turned out by US plants last year was built without at least some imported parts. The tariffs on parts could now mean tens of billions of dollars in new cost to the industry – and eventually to American car buyers and owners.

“Frankly, from my perspective, (the parts tariffs) looks worse for the broader economy than the tariffs on imported vehicles,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, at an Automotive Press Association webinar this past week.

More than 50% of the content of cars assembled in American auto plants is imported, according to the government’s own estimates. But the tariffs won’t apply equally to all those imports.

For example, parts from Canadian or Mexican suppliers who pay their workers $16 or more an hour are deemed “compliant” with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal negotiated during the first Trump administration. That means most Canadian parts are exempt from tariffs, but relatively few Mexican parts.

And as of last week, automakers assembling cars in the United States will be able to offset part of the parts tariff, at least temporarily. The White House said it would refund automakers up to 3.75% of price of the vehicle against their parts tariffs bill in the first year, sliding to 2.5% in the second year before being phased out in the third year.

But even with that refund, the added cost of tariffs could still come to an average of about $4,000 per vehicle, according to estimates derived from a CNN analysis of government trade data.

For car buyers, it might take awhile to see price hikes. General Motors CEO Mary Barra told CNN Thursday tariffs will cost her company between $4 billion and $5 billion this year, but she doesn’t expect car prices to change in the near term. Ford CEO Jim Farley told CNN on Wednesday that it would extend its “employee pricing” offer through July 4.

But everyday Americans will still see higher prices elsewhere, like the repair shop.

“The tariffs on parts that will lead to higher inflation in repair and maintenance and insurance which impact every American and not just the people thinking about buying a new imported vehicle,” Smoke said.

# No such thing as an all-American car

The recent change in the parts tariff rules means any car assembled in the United States with 85% “USMCA compliant” parts would essentially be tariff-free.

The problem is that virtually no vehicle meets that 85% threshold, according to analysis by Frank DuBois, a retired professor at American University’s Kogod School of Business.

That’s because automakers have been operating for decades as if North America is a single market, moving parts repeatedly across the US borders with Canada and Mexico with few if any tariffs.

Judging which content is actually domestic could be tough, as well, DuBois said, getting down to such minor points as where the oil and antifreeze come from.

Besides the $19.2 billion in imported Canadian components, most other imported parts will not be exempt.

For example, Mexico sent $82.5 billion in parts to the United States last year, by far the largest source of imported parts. But few of those are considered “USMCA compliant,” so most will have the tariff attached.

If current tariffs for auto parts (and additional levies for Chinese goods in general) had been in effect last year, the total price tag would have been about $60 billion. Even with the refund rules announced this past week would only have taken that bill down to $40 billion.

The parts refund, Smoke said, is just about “taking a bad situation and making it slightly less worse.”

StockMarket,New Tesla sales in Spain drop 36% in April despite EV sales surge,"(Reuters) -Tesla's new car sales in Spain fell 36% in April from the same month in 2024 to 571 vehicles, registration data released by industry group ANFAC showed on Monday, while sales of electric cars from other brands soared.

Over the first four months of 2025, sales of Teslas in Spain fell 17% over the same period a year earlier, while sales of electrified vehicles, a category that includes both fully electric vehicles and hybrids, were up 54%.

Sales of Teslas have dropped in Europe as the manufacturer owned by billionaire Elon Musk faces increased competition from European and especially Chinese EV brands.

Musk's embrace of far-right politics in Europe has also led to protests against him and the company, as well as vandalism at its showrooms and charging stations across the U.S. and Europe.

Musk said two weeks ago he would cut back on the time he devotes to the Trump administration and spend more time running Tesla.

In Spain, sales of Chinese automakers BYD, MG and Omoda were up 644%, 80% and 346% so far this year, respectively, ANFAC's report showed.

StockMarket,Warren Buffett: 'Trade should not be a weapon',"The first question for Warren Buffett at the [Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting-buffett-says-trade-should-not-be-a-weapon-114823274.html) involved world trade as [President Trump's tariff policy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-tariffs-live-updates-china-says-door-is-open-to-trade-talks-with-the-us-191201877.html) disrupts the status quo.

""Trade should not be a weapon,"" Buffett said at the end of a detailed answer about the history of the United States and how global trade developed.

""We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world,"" the 94-year-old investor said, ""and we should do what we do best, and they should do what they do best. ... I do not think it's a great idea to try and design a world where a few countries say 'ha ha ha we've won,' and other countries are envious.""

Buffett later added that ""the United States, we've won. We've become an incredibly important country, starting from nothing 250 years ago. There's nothing that's anything like it. And it's a big mistake, in my view, when you have 7.5 billion people that don't like you very well and 300 million that are crowing in some way about how well they've done. I don't think it's right, and I don't think it's wise.""

In an interview earlier this year, Buffett said tariffs can be an act of economic war. Buffett reiterated these comments on Saturday, saying: ""Trade can be an act of war. And I think it's led to bad things.""

Part of the question touched on [Buffett's 2003 plan](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/growing.pdf) to create ""import certificates"" that would reimagine how trade is accounted for. Buffett said the goal was simply to find a way to balance trade around the world — adding that his longtime partner Charlie Munger considered the idea somewhat of a gimmick.

StockMarket,Trump Rules Out Firing Powell While Pushing Him to Cut Rates,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump insisted he doesn’t plan to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell despite his sustained criticism over the pace of interest rate cuts.

“Why would I do that?” he said in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press with Kristen Welker that aired Sunday. “I get to replace the person in another short period of time.”

On Wednesday, Trump issued another denunciation of the central bank chief as as the president faces growing pressure from the backlash to his sweeping deployment of tariffs.

Powell’s term as chair ends in May 2026.

Fed officials are widely expected to hold rates steady when they meet in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday. While concerns of a possible recession are mounting, government data on Friday showed a strong 177,000 jump in April payrolls.

If the Fed indeed declines to cut rates, Powell, who was appointed by Trump in 2018, could face even more pressure.

Trump said in the interview taped Friday that Powell doesn’t want to cut rates “because he’s not a fan of mine. You know, he just doesn’t like me because I think he’s a total stiff.”

Senior aides, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have privately urged Trump to soothe jittery markets by making clear he’s not planning to remove Powell, Bloomberg has reported. In mid-April, Trump set off fears by saying in a social media post that “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” followed by Oval Office remarks to reporters that “if I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me.”

Trump also defended his mass deportations of undocumented migrants and complained about judicial rulings requiring the administration to give immigrants due process before deporting them.

Asked if he needs to uphold the Constitution, Trump said, “I don’t know.”

He added, “I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.”

Trump also defended his tariff policy, saying that companies are starting to move production facilities to the US. He added that he isn’t ruling out making the tariffs permanent.

“I wouldn’t do that, because if somebody thought they were going to come off the table, why would they build in the United States?” he said.

The president was asked again whether he was considering running for a third term, even though it’s prohibited by the Constitution. On March 30 he told NBC that “a lot of people want me to do it” but it was too early to make a decision. On Sunday, he seemed to rule it out.

“This is not something I’m looking to do,” he said, while citing Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as possible successors. “I’m looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward.”

StockMarket,Berkshire Hathaway vs. the S&P 500: 60 Years of Outperformance,"I just looked at Berkshire Hathaway’s newly updated performance table — and the numbers are absolutely wild.

From 1964 to 2024:
Berkshire Hathaway delivered a total gain of +5,502,284%
S&P 500 (with dividends included) returned +39,054%

The compounded annual gain:
19.9% for Berkshire
10.4% for the S&P 500

Buffett has always said he wouldn’t be able to match his past performance again, and yet, year after year, he’s continued to outperform the index.

A few things that stood out:
Even in weak years, Berkshire often managed to lose less or stay resilient (see 2000, 2001, 2008).
The consistency is insane: nearly 20% annually over six decades.

Now that Buffett is stepping down, do you think Berkshire still has what it takes to outperform the S&P 500… or is the golden era officially over?",https://i.redd.it/ob0uuqozosye1.jpeg,2025-05-04 16:52:06,Reddit

China’s central bank and financial regulators announced major stimulus measures to support economic growth amid trade tensions. The People’s Bank of China will reduce the seven-day reverse repurchase rate by 10 basis points to 1.4%, which is expected to lower the loan prime rate by a similar amount. Additionally, the reserve requirement ratio will be cut by 50 basis points, injecting 1 trillion yuan ($138.6 billion) into the banking system to boost liquidity and lending.

Will Powell follow with either policy ( cut rate or cut reserve ratio)? though China even with the tariffs is expected to have a better gdp performance vs usa, I would like to think that Powell will keep the interests rates « as is » until further clarity on the US/ China negotiations .The contrast is obvious .

StockMarket,PM Carney to meet with President Trump in Washington on Tuesday,"Prime Minister Mark Carney will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss trade and security.

Carney announced the trip during a news conference Friday morning, his first time taking questions from media since the Liberals won Monday's federal election.

""It's important to get engaged immediately, which has always been my intention, which has always been \[Trump's\] intention,"" he told reporters in Ottawa. ""I'm pleased to have the opportunity for quite a comprehensive set of meetings that will take place on Tuesday.""

Carney made negotiations with Trump a cornerstone of his campaign, arguing he would be best to shepherd Canada through a trade war with the U.S. and Trump's annexationist threats. But the prime minister said Tuesday's meeting doesn't necessarily mean there will be an immediate resolution to the tariff issue.

""Do not expect white smoke out of that meeting,"" Carney said jokingly, referring to the upcoming papal conclave.

While he indicated that the meeting itself was a good sign that things are moving in a positive direction, Carney repeated what he had said during the campaign: that the traditional relationship with the U.S. is ""over"" and that his government is looking for new trading relationships with other partners.

Carney also emphasized that he's intent on building the Canadian economy to be less reliant on the U.S.

""We have more than enough to do here at home…. We can have a bigger boost to our economy, to incomes, to jobs by focusing on building one Canadian economy, by building these nation-building projects, by focusing on getting productivity up, by reducing government waste, by driving investment in this country,"" he said.

""We're going to focus on that while we have these negotiations with the Americans, and if the negotiations with the Americans take longer, so be it. We've got more than enough to do here.""

StockMarket,"China says US eager to negotiate on tariffs, Beijing’s door is ’open’","BEIJING (Reuters) -The United States has approached China to seek talks over President Donald Trump’s 145% tariffs and Beijing’s door is open for discussions, China’s Commerce Ministry said on Friday, signalling a potential de-escalation in the trade war.Source:

The U.S. should be prepared to take action in correcting ""erroneous"" practices and cancel unilateral tariffs, the commerce ministry said in a statement, adding that Washington needs to show ""sincerity"" in negotiations.

""Attempting to use talks as a pretext to engage in coercion and extortion would not work,"" the commerce ministry said.

Beijing has openly expressed its anger at the tariffs, which it says are tantamount to bullying and cannot stop the rise of the world’s second-largest economy.

It has directed its fury at rallying public and global condemnation of Washington’s import curbs.

Alongside leveraging its propaganda machine to hit back at the duties, China has quietly created a list of U.S.-made products it will exempt from its retaliatory 125% tariffs - including select pharmaceuticals, microchips and jet engines - Reuters has reported.

On the U.S. side, officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, have also expressed hope for progress in easing trade tensions.

Trump said on Wednesday he believed there was a ""very good chance"" his administration could do a deal with China, hours after Chinese President Xi Jinping called on officials to take action to adjust to changes in the international environment, without explicitly mentioning the United States.

What I’m really wondering now is: what does this mean for Berkshire going forward?

Abel is smart and experienced, no doubt. But can he truly carry the same vision and discipline that Buffett and Munger built over decades?

# Fed's Interest Rate Decision Comes Amid Political Pressure to Lower Rates

The Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on Wednesday comes as the central bank faces increasing [political pressure to lower interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/trump-hints-at-firing-powell-after-fed-chair-signals-no-rate-cut-soon-11717006). But so far, investors don’t expect the Fed will lower rates from its current levels of 4.25%-4.5%, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.1

The Fed’s decision comes after the central bank got more [encouraging inflation news](https://www.investopedia.com/inflation-was-flat-in-march-pce-measure-shows-11724760) last week when March’s inflation rate was in line with expectations, though still above the target.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s [comments after the decision](https://www.investopedia.com/federal-reserve-chair-jerome-powell-emphasizes-inflation-risks-of-trump-tariffs-trade-war-11716687) follow weeks of [scrutiny from President Trump](https://www.investopedia.com/trump-criticism-of-powell-is-shaking-markets-faith-in-federal-reserve-independence-11719211), which has raised questions over whether the president could remove the Fed chair from his position and what that would mean for central bank independence. 

On Friday, the Federal Reserve’s blackout period ends with a noteworthy event that will feature a string of speakers that include Federal Reserve Governors Lisa Cook and Christopher Waller, New York Fed President John Williams, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem. Also speaking at the event is former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, a key adviser to Trump who has been critical of the Federal Reserve and is thought to be one of the president’s candidates to succeed Powell.2

Investors may also look to other key economic releases this week, including [trade balance data](https://www.investopedia.com/u-s-trade-deficit-soars-are-buyers-racing-to-beat-tariffs-8782399) on Tuesday and initial jobless claims on Thursday. Wednesday’s scheduled report on consumer credit comes as economists are evaluating consumer health [amid faltering confidence](https://www.investopedia.com/falling-consumer-confidence-has-set-off-this-recession-alarm-11724208), while Thursday’s wholesale inventories report could provide insight on supply chain resilience as trade tensions remain high.

investing,I talked with a Chinese factory owner to see what’s happening on the ground. TL;DR: China has mobilized tons of resources to exporters but there’s some signs of pain,"I’m an American in China but have been seeing very little foreign reporting about what’s happening in China, which is weird to me because it seems pretty important to get a clear picture of the trade war. So here’s what I learned from him.

**Gov support**

-The local government is helping and giving him low interest rate loans / short term financial support. This type of thing is very common throughout China right now - lots of local govs are mobilizing to support exporters thru the tariff war. Li Qiang, central gov minister, says central government help is probably coming too 

-Guangzhou, and I assume others too, has also organized tons of seminars since Liberation Day with buyers from Europe, Latin America, and Asia. A big source of replacement demand for his factory has been from these

-He’s getting lots of buyers from TikTok shops overseas. It seems like TikTok is helping a lot to mitigate the demand impact 

-The news story of Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. resuming some orders is true, he confirmed it. But the amounts are **very, very** small

**Pain**

-He’s already re-evaluating employees and firing some soon. He said most exporters in Guangzhou are cutting some employees, but extremely US dependent exporters have furloughed most of their workforces until mid May

**Some good news for the U.S?**

-Before Liberation Day he was building a factory in the US and has now fully committed to it. But it’s having issues since the raw materials are sourced from China and they’re getting hit with tariffs

investing,McDonald's reports largest revenue drop in US since pandemic as consumers pull back on spending,"Sales shrank almost 4%, at 3.6%.

It's concerning when fast food and retail businesses start seeing contradicting sales from the US consumer. Especially staples that are concerned with affordability like Walmart and McDonalds. If Consumers are pulling back spending on ""cheap"", low cart value items like a McDonalds meal then it signals to me a budget constrained, worried consumer who won't spend.

The flip side of this that other fast food companies like Domino's have been doing fine. So maybe this is also a combination of McDonald's price hikes, lack of promotions and affordability, and increased competition. It could be both the macro and also the company specific issues that created this result.

As stated in the post title, the number today (i.e. ~~35~~ 38 companies) is equivalent to the amount 3 weeks into the pandemic. (in total, the pandemic ended up with over 800 companies suspending guidance.) While suspending guidance isn't a straight up indicator of a recession, the surge in guidance suspensions across multiple sectors, especially among large-cap or economically sensitive companies, is a strong warning sign of economic distress.

As a young person just starting to get into investing, a series of questions have been on my mind.

How is it that in the last five years we have seen record increases in commodities, stocks, housing, and inflation? 

It feels like I came into adulthood at one of the absolute worst times in history? The price of gold was $1,500/oz in 2020. The median home price in the United States was a little more than $300,000. Stocks and index’s have seen 100-200% gains in five years. All while wages remain stagnant, and the price of goods, and the cost of living increase. 

Do we live in an era where investments continuously increase year over year with insane returns? How is this sustainable?

Edit:

Since everyone is taking “It feels like I came into adulthood at one of the absolute worst times in history” so seriously I’ll say this as an exaggeration. For me personally, and the people of my generation, it seems we’ve entered adulthood where economic conditions are not ideal.

investing,WSJ: Why There Will Never Be Another Warren Buffett,"A great article by Jason Zweig on Warren Buffett after his announcement that he will retire at year-end.

https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/why-there-will-never-be-another-warren-buffett-2b5fa268

Excerpt:

There’s only one Warren Buffett, and there will never be another.

On May 3, Buffett announced that he will step down as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate he has built into one of the most successful investments in history. There are three reasons why he has no equal and never will: the person, the period and the package.

Let’s start with the person. Buffett is not only brilliant, but he has also spent nearly his entire long lifetime obsessed with the stock market. Especially in his early years as an investor, his unparalleled success depended on an unbearable sacrifice: forgoing a normal social and family life. 

Ever since 1942, when he bought his first stock at age 11, he has devoured information about companies, reading corporate reports the way most people listen to music. 

As a young investment manager, Buffett would wander through his house with his nose in a corporate annual report, practically bumping into the furniture, oblivious to the comings and goings of family and friends. While his kids played at an amusement park, he would sit on a bench and read financial statements. Buffett was there physically, but mentally and emotionally he was off in a world of his own, fixated on tax-loss carryforwards and amortization schedules.

Imagine being that obsessed. Imagine enjoying it.

Now imagine enjoying it almost every waking moment ever since Harry Truman was in the White House. That’s how unusual Buffett is.

Expertise is rooted in pattern recognition, and Buffett has seen every conceivable pattern. Given what I know about his work habits, I estimate—conservatively, I believe—that Buffett has read more than 100,000 financial statements in his more-than-seven-decade career. 

Finally, Buffett placed his investments in a package like none other.

Berkshire Hathaway operates as a publicly traded holding company, a receptacle for whatever he has thought worth owning: other publicly traded stocks, Treasury bonds, private companies. At one point it was even one of the world’s largest holders of silver; now it holds more than $330 billion in cash. 

Berkshire isn’t a hedge fund, mutual fund, exchange-traded fund or any other conventional investment vehicle.

By design, it charges no management fees that would subtract from its returns and no performance-incentive fees that would encourage excessive risk-taking in pursuit of a big payday.

Most investment funds operate under a curse that economists call “procyclicality.” After a fund racks up a streak of good returns, investors throw money at the fund, forcing its managers to put the new cash to work in a market that is likely becoming overpriced. That hinders future performance.

Then, when returns falter in a falling market, investors yank their money out, forcing the fund managers to sell just as bargains are becoming abundant. The fund’s own investors make its performance worse, intensifying the market’s ups and downs.

Berkshire’s only cash flows, however, are internal. Money comes in from (or goes out to) the assets it owns. Cash can’t come pouring in from new investors, or get yanked out by fleeing investors, at the worst possible times—because you can invest in Berkshire only by buying shares from someone else in the secondary market.

This package has given Buffett a structural advantage that has enabled him to pursue opportunities wherever and whenever he has perceived them. That’s a luxury almost no other professional investor has—or even wants.

So long as most fund managers can earn a lavish living for underperforming the market, the real risk for them will be trying anything different. Pigs will sprout feathers before anybody has the daring to try truly emulating Warren Buffett.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kebiu8/wsj_why_there_will_never_be_another_warren_buffett/,2025-05-04 04:30:33,Reddit

My plan was to DCA cash into the market, particularly VOO, QQQM and VXUS on a bi weekly basis until I am out of “dry powder” so to speak.

However, how can I mitigate the risk of a lost decade?

Looking at stocks, you could argue most (especially the large cap stocks) are still overvalued.

However, alternative investments don’t look great right now either.

Gold is at all time highs.

BTC is near all time highs and the rest of crypto is a shit show.

Real estate is super expensive and rates are still high.

It seems there aren’t many great options to get a solid return on your money right now without taking on substantial risk, either of a big crash or of a sideways decade that sees little to no returns.

Given the consumer hasn't yet felt the pinch of tariffs working their way through the system cost-wise, nor have businesses and consumers fully felt whatever shock may (or may not) come from supply chain disruptions, I can't help but wonder if today's market has priced all of that risk in given the rapid rebound.

This banker survived 2008, COVID, and inflation while others failed his blunt talk and long-term vision keep paying off when Wall Street panic sets in.","I know this might be an unpopular opinion, but I've developed a genuine respect for Jamie Dimon over the years.

Think about what he's navigated as CEO of JPMorgan Chase the 2008 financial crisis (which his bank weathered better than most), the European debt crisis, the pandemic shock, and now this high-inflation environment. Through all of this, JPMorgan has remained one of the strongest financial institutions in the world.

Yes, he's made mistakes and JPMorgan has paid its share of fines. But what impresses me is how he speaks with refreshing clarity in an industry full of doublespeak. When he warns about economic risks, he's usually right. When politicians from either side try to pressure him on policy positions, he maintains independence.

While other bank CEOs have come and gone (or been forced out during crises), Dimon has maintained steady leadership since 2005. He seems to actually care about the long-term health of both his company and the broader economy rather than just quarterly numbers.

In an era where most financial leaders seem to be either political puppets or focused solely on short-term gains, I find his consistency and straightforwardness admirable.

The EU’s pushing it as a move to bolster local tech, but it feels like a direct shot at U.S. dominance.I know the narrative is that these companies are “too big to fail” and have global supply chains to cushion the blow, but hear me out:

* Higher costs could squeeze margins, especially for hardware-heavy firms like Apple.
* If the EU doubles down (like they did with GDPR), could we see a broader tech trade war? China’s already hinted at “reciprocal measures.”
* Smaller tech ETFs (thinking XSD or SOXX) might take a bigger hit than the FAANG-heavy ones.

Yet, I’m seeing barely any chatter about this. Are we all too focused on AI hype or the Fed’s rate cuts to notice? Or is this just a blip that’ll fizzle out?

According to a memo I received, (would attach but this community doesn’t allow it 🙄) over 12 million email addresses and usernames were stolen and later leaked on BreachForums—11 million of those were linked to hashed passwords. Even worse, other sensitive data like names, phone numbers, IP addresses, and physical addresses were included in the leaked package.

Apparently, this isn’t the first time either. Zacks was hit twice, with the second breach allegedly occurring in June 2024.

What frustrates me the most is that I was never contacted by Zacks. No heads-up, no recommendation to reset my password, not even a confirmation of what password was breached so I could check if it’s still in use anywhere else.

If you’ve ever signed up for Zacks or used their services, check if your data was compromised using tools like HaveIBeenPwned, and consider changing your passwords ASAP.

Zacks owes users transparency, and at the very least, notification.

investing,BEA GDP estimate comes in at -0.3% annualized,"https://www.bea.gov/news/2025/gross-domestic-product-1st-quarter-2025-advance-estimate


## Gross Domestic Product, 1st Quarter 2025 (Advance Estimate)

Real gross domestic product (GDP) decreased at an annual rate of 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2025 (January, February, and March), according to the advance estimate released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the fourth quarter of 2024, real GDP increased 2.4 percent.

Real GDP: Percent change from preceding quarter
The decrease in real GDP in the first quarter primarily reflected an increase in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, and a decrease in government spending. These movements were partly offset by increases in investment, consumer spending, and exports. For more information, refer to the ""Technical Notes"" below.

Contributions to Percent Change in Real GDP, 1st Quarter 2025
Compared to the fourth quarter, the downturn in real GDP in the first quarter reflected an upturn in imports, a deceleration in consumer spending, and a downturn in government spending that were partly offset by upturns in investment and exports.

Real final sales to private domestic purchasers, the sum of consumer spending and gross private fixed investment, increased 3.0 percent in the first quarter, compared with an increase of 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter.

The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 3.4 percent in the first quarter, compared with an increase of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 3.6 percent, compared with an increase of 2.4 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, the PCE price index increased 3.5 percent, compared with an increase of 2.6 percent",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kbfxqt/bea_gdp_estimate_comes_in_at_03_annualized/,2025-04-30 13:02:48,Reddit
investing,What's gonna happen to Canada market after Trump film tariffs?,"Major U.S. studios like Warner, Disney, and Netflix have long relied on Canadian cities like Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal as production hubs due to lower costs, generous tax credits, and proximity to the U.S. border. In many cases, productions that appear “American” are actually shot entirely in Canada.

If Trump’s proposed 100% film tariff goes through, will studios like Warner Bros. start pulling out of Canada? That’s an $11B industry potentially at risk.

investing,Strong Demand at Treasury Auction Suggests Market Still Stable — No Panic Here :,"
The latest 3-year Treasury auction wrapped up with solid demand. The high yield came in at 3.824%, and the majority of the paper went to real buyers — not just primary dealers being forced to absorb it. In fact, indirect bidders (foreigns) scooped up a big chunk, and SOMA took down over $20B, keeping liquidity flowing.

What matters here isn’t just the numbers — it’s the signal. No one’s panicking. No one’s dumping Treasuries. If yields had spiked or the auction flopped, that would’ve been a red flag. But this was smooth. Clean. Stable.

For equities, this is a quiet green light. The bond market isn’t screaming inflation, funding stress, or rate shock.

He is coming to live with me for a while so he can save some money and get himself on a good path in life while he decides what he wants to do (school, military, career, etc). 
I will be charging him rent but aside from putting a little extra into the household expenses, I'm planning to put most of it back for him as a ""you did good, here's a gift to get you going"" thing when he moves out as I'm doing reasonably well myself and don't really need the extra. 
Now, having said all that, I'm wanting to know what I can have HIM invest in while he's working to set himself up as well as he can. I'm already helping him separately save up an emergency fund ($1500) and money for some other expenses we know he will have, but aside from that, I want him to put some money into some long term stuff that will set him up as well as is possible while he's got this opportunity.

investing,How will you bet on the market given the looming shortages and price increases?,"What do folks think the best strategies will be for profiting from the upcoming supply shortages and price increases?

I don’t think the market has priced this in, and it’s not immediately clear which industries/companies will most feel the pain.

My hypothesis is that there will be shortages on a wide array of goods, considering how much shipping traffic to the US is going down. And of course, retailers will try to recoup as much of tariffs as possible. Small businesses will be hurt the most -  not sure if there is a second order effect here that could be interesting (e.g., public companies that generate a lot of revenue providing services to small companies).

This feels a lot like COVID, when it was obvious it was coming but the market didn’t appreciate it. In that case, I bought puts on the S&P (prob an ETF, don’t remember) and did relatively well. But not sure if a broad bet this time is right, because some industries won’t be as affected.

For instance, maybe Amazon or Walmart takes a hit because they can’t source enough goods and prices go up. Is there an interesting ETF focused on retailers that you could bet against?  Or maybe there are medium sized retailers already on the ropes who get walloped.

investing,Microsoft Stock Lands Rare Downgrade After ‘Exceptional’ Quarter — But It Has Nothing To Do With Fundamentals: Retail’s Bullish,"The firm believes that Microsoft is strategically positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for expensive artificial intelligence models.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) has gained 10% over the two sessions since it reported its third-quarter results. 

Friday’s close of $435.28 meant Microsoft stock has turned positive for the year with a year-to-date gain of 3.5%.

Notwithstanding the investor optimism over the Satya Nadella-led company, an analyst downgraded the stock on Sunday. The Fly reported that research firm Phillip Securities downgraded the Microsoft stock to ‘Accumulate’ from ‘Buy’ but left the price target unchanged at $480.

The firm attributed the downgrade to the stock rally amid the recent market upturn and the company’s earnings.

Phillip Securities analysts, however, believe that Microsoft is strategically positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for expensive artificial intelligence (AI) models, which in turn enhances the attractiveness of the Azure public cloud platform.

The firm also sees minimal impact from the Trump tariffs, given Microsoft’s strong enterprise customer base and the accent on its cloud service.

Microsoft stock is still trading off its all-time high of $467.70, hit on July 8, 2024.

Last Wednesday, Microsoft reported a solid third-quarter beat and issued positive guidance. The company also said it expects strong Azure revenue growth and a sequential increase in capital spending.

Following the results, Microsoft analysts hiked their price targets, with the new targets ranging from $475 to $550. Analysts called the quarter an “exceptional one.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kf7rk5/microsoft_stock_lands_rare_downgrade_after/,2025-05-05 09:56:34,Reddit

investing,Looking to put some $$ away for my future kid,"I grew up in an upper middle class family. I always got a ton of gifts more my birthdays and Christmas, was able to try different sports, go to college, and will soon be attending grad school. All because my parents worked their butts off to give me those things. And I will be forever grateful for the things they did for me. But I am trying to also learn from their mistakes.

While my parents have always made good money, they’ve never been able to fully dedicate themselves to saving for themselves. They’ve also spent a good portion of life living at their means, and not below it, even before sending me off to higher education. It’s put a lot of stress on them and I don’t want to repeat that. I’ve already got some money invest myself ($2,500 into a Roth IRA and $1,500 into the S&P 500 at 23 years old). I’m trying to set myself up for success, but also want to set my future kid up for success as well.

Due to some personal reasons, I’m not feeling up for getting married or starting a traditional family in my lifetime. However, I do want to have a kid, be it through foster care/adoption or through other means. And I want to make sure that kid has a decent running start once they turn 18. If I can play my cards right, I am going to buy myself a house that will allow me to live well under my means and invest in both myself and my child. I’ll be more aggressive saving for myself, but I want to put at least $100 away for my future child every single month for 18 years, and then give that child the money on their 18th birthday. And I want to make sure I’m yielding as much money from that account as possible once those 18 years are up. 

Would it be better to put that money in a HYSA for them to have at their disposal once they turn 18, or put it into an investment and gift them the account once those 18 years have passed, if that’s possible?

Some background: I make $97k a year and only have to pay for utilities. Auto loan and student debt is about $1000 per month and will be paid off in about 2 years. I have about 80k in investments: 40k in a 457b split 50/50 between Roth and traditional, 20k in a personal traditional IRA, and 20k in class C mutual funds.

- [**Form C-AR (Apr 28, 2025)**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1817417/000167025425000448/xslC_X01/primary_doc.xml): Their annual report shows **only $242,490** in cash for 2024 — a steep drop from 2023.

This raises some big questions:

- Why did they leave the outdated 2023 number in the new C/A, even though the 2024 data was already filed?  
- Does this suggest a lack of transparency, or is it just a sloppy oversight?  
- Should investors be concerned that the campaign page and public filings may mislead those who don’t read both docs?

investing,"Expecting a large tax credit, looking for a little advice","I am planning on investing in a solar system for my house in the next couple of months - Based on what I'm getting, I should be getting somewhere in the area of a 10K tax credit. 

Now, the loan for the solar system wants me to apply the credit to the loan to drop my monthly payment down.. But I'd still be paying on the loan for \~30 years. I'm fine with that if need be, worst case scenario I count for the payoff in the cost of the house if/when I sell.  I can afford the higher payment, but it'll be a little uncomfortable for a bit.

  
What I'm curious about though.. Is there something I could do with that credit that would let me double or triple it in the next 2-5 years? Then I could turn around and pay the loan off immediately instead of dragging it out over 30 years. 

  
Alternatively, same question but for a lesser amount - Say I put half of the credit towards the loan to have a little easier payment, and use the other half to try and grow it in the next 5 years to pay off the loan. Is that possible?

investing,"Three fundamentally strong companies, temporarily mispriced due to short-term fears","I've been digging into a few high-quality businesses that I believe are facing temporary dislocations. Below are my analyses of Novo Nordisk ($NVO), Bruker Corp. ($BRKR), and The Trade Desk ($TTD). I believe that each of these companies are showing strong long-term fundamentals, but are trading well below intrinsic value. 

**Novo Nordisk ($NVO)**

This is a classic case of “short term fear, long term value”. Novo Nordisk is a global leader in GLP-1–based treatments for diabetes and obesity, with drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. Despite continued double-digit revenue and earnings growth, the stock has dropped over 50% YTD. This is primarily due to concerns over market share gains by Eli Lilly and others, short-term supply constraints, and fears of margin compression. These concerns, while not unfounded, appear significantly overblown relative to the company’s long-term fundamentals.

Crucially, the GLP-1 market is not a winner-takes-all market. The market is expanding rapidly and I believe they can support multiple dominant players. Novo still holds best-in-class margins (>35%), a robust product pipeline (e.g. CagriSema), and global distribution infrastructure. The obesity therapeutics market is forecast to exceed $130B by 2030, meaning even a modestly declining market share can still translate into absolute revenue and profit growth. Therefore, I believe the current sentiment-driven pricing creates a clear mispricing where fair value lies in the $110–$140 range. Novo is a high-quality compounder caught in a temporary dislocation. Not a value trap, but a classic contrarian long. The strategic collaboration with Hims & Hers ($HIMS) and CVS ($CVS) may be a catalyst for the price to rebound quickly.

**Bruker Corp. ($BRKR)**

Bruker Corp. builds advanced scientific instruments used in life sciences and materials research, including cancer diagnostics and drug development. Despite growing revenue by 13.6% in 2024 and maintaining strong free cash flow, the stock has dropped over 50% since late 2024. The decline stems from short-term margin pressure, weakness in China/biopharma demand, and costs tied to a strategic reorganization aimed at scaling operations and unlocking long-term efficiencies.

This reorganization, including several acquisitions, temporarily weighs on margins, but positions Bruker for stronger profitability over time. I believe that the market is mispricing this short-term transition as a structural decline. Insiders and Michael Burry seem to think so as well, as they have initiated positions in the last months. With the stock trading at attractive multiples (compared to hystorical multiples and its peers) and core markets like proteomics still expanding, Bruker looks undervalued. With forward EPS of around $2.70 and an average P/E-ratio of around 30, a re-rating toward $80 is likely if margins rebound and sentiment shifts.

**The Trade Desk ($TTD)**

The Trade Desk is a leading independent demand-side platform (DSP) enabling advertisers to allocate digital ad budgets effectively, with a strong presence in connected TV, retail media, and cookieless identity solutions through its UID2.0 framework. The stock has fallen over 60% from around $140 in late 2024 to $53 as of now. This is due to weaker-than-expected forward guidance, delays in launching its AI-based platform Kokai, and a broader market rotation away from high-multiple tech stocks.

However, the sell-off seems a major overreaction of the market. The company remains highly profitable, continues growing revenue at 20%+ annually, generates strong free cash flow, and maintains incredible customer retention rates of >95%. Secular tailwinds in streaming and privacy-focused ad tech support long-term demand for its platform. The market seems to be mispricing a temporary slowdown as a structural decline. Based on their growth, their postion as market leader, and hystorical multiples, I believe the fair value to be at least $100 in the short term. This feels just like Meta ($META) at $90 in 2022.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kf7qgd/three_fundamentally_strong_companies_temporarily/,2025-05-05 09:54:30,Reddit

investing,Help me build a strong tech-oriented portfolio for the future,"Hi all,

I hope everyone is doing well. 

I'm keen on getting your opinion on building a strong  growth portfolio for the future. Taking into consideration the market volatility due to the uncertainty of tariffs and possible imminent recession I believe this is a great time to do so.

Its almost certain that the tech industry will continue to grow as it explores new and innovative tech especially in the fields of AI , quantum and what not.

I want to build a strong portfolio based on that. I feel like it is inevitable that the direction we are taking will be 

1. New and improved ways of computing such as Heterogeneous , Quantum , Neuromorphic computing. 

2. New and improved consumer electronic such as AR/VR/MR , robots , AI agents

3. Cutting edge technologies in the fields of lithography (EUV and beyond --> ASML) and manufacturing (TSMC)

 Now , obviously the big tech companies are well positioned for all of the above and resilient during economic downturns (meaning they will take a hit but surely they will around once it all finishes), but I would also like to include some mid-cap companies with great potential or / and some non-US companies as well.

Also I'm more interest in picking a dozen of companies for example rather than a tech ETF  so that should help.

So how did you learn about fundamentals of stock market investing ? 

I am open to learning from books or YouTube. 

I already invest in index funds. 

I want to invest in individual stocks as well. And learn how to pick stocks for long term and/or dividends. 

I am not planning to do day trading. 

I have searched this and few other subreddits for answers and watched YouTube videos recommended. Plain bagel , Patrick Boyle , Ackmen, Martin shkerli etc. 
I made an attempt to read intelligent investor failed. 

Most of the channels recommended were either - “what is a stock”  or advanced stuff like analyzing companies and strategies.

However I do not understand the terminology and the fundamentals to be able to understand more in depth analysis. 

Could you recommend a book or videos that will teach about fundamentals, terminology ?

investing,What would you do with cash out of these options?,"So I got some large sum available to me for investment as I sold a property (tax-free gains). With the current scenario of the politics, economy, and uncertainty, i am really worried where to plug this money right now. 

Amount is about 20% of my net worth. All in taxable account right now and I have parked it in PULS (ultra short term bond fund with \~4 to 4.5% returns).

  
Here is what I am thinking, appreciate some help in selecting the better option:

  
1. Option 1 - DCA into broad index funds (VT, VOO, etc.) with a bigger focus on global diversification, rather than just US. I also know the India market well, so I could buy some stocks directly in India (or an ETF).

  
2. Option 2 - But some of the big names in the market and invest a good sum into those stocks over next 6 months to DCA the price. I can then do covered calls on these stocks to keep generating income.

  
3. Option 3 - Take some extra risk and invest in potential high growth stocks (think Archer, Rocket Labs, etc.) - maybe 10-15% of this money goes into these stocks, with hope of them rising in next few years.

  
Other consideration:

1. Mostly won't need this money for next 5-7 years. no plan to purchase a house as of now.

2. I am comfortable with cash secured puts and covered calls, so am also considering doing some CSP's on SPY and earning good income on this cash and also potentially getting SPY for slightly lower price

  
What would you do? I know long term stocks would recovered, etc. - but I anticipate a correction and want to sit a bit on sideline.

investing,For info: Here are a selection of dividend paying ETFs available to European investors for consideration,"A lot of people are asking about ETFs that are available to European investors. The popular among Americans SCHD ETF from Schwab is unfortunately not available to European investors due to regulatory restrictions, as US-domiciled ETFs do not comply with EU regulations.

Here is my list of ETFs that are available for your consideration and further research:

**1) ISF: iShares Core FTSE 100 UCITS ETF GBP Dist**

This is a FTSE 100 (UK's top 100 companies) index fund. Another fund that tracks the same would be VUKE from Vanguard. Vanguard has low fees but only allows investments into their own funds, so you may prefer VUKE to ISF if that is your preferred platform.

**2) VHYL: FTSE All-World High Dividend Yield UCITS ETF**

This is a hugely popular ETF with Europeans. There are $5.8 Billion assets under management in this investment. It is a select of high yielding dividend stocks and the top holdings are all well known excellent companies. It is a global fund so offers some degree of diversification, though it leans heavily towards US stocks with 42.8% of the ETF being US based. The number of stocks this ETF invests in is 2,192.

**3) VUSA: Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF USD Dis**

This is an S&P 500 index fund from Vanguard. It is an equivalent to the US based ETF VOO that you have probably seen all over.

**4) EUE: iShares Core EURO STOXX 50 UCITS ETF EUR Dist**

This ETF seeks to track the performance of an index composed of 50 of the largest companies in the Eurozone. It is a very good complimentary piece to US based or weighted ETFs for diversification reasons. It also comes with the added fringe benefit of having a payout scheduled that operates on different quarters to most other ETFs, meaning you can emulate a monthly salaried income by incorporating this ETF (though you obviously should not invest based on pay out schedule alone).

**5) GBDV: SPDR S&P Global Dividend Aristocrats UCITS ETF Dis**

The objective of the ETF is to track the performance of high dividend yielding equities globally.

**6) USDV: SPDR S&P U.S. Dividend Aristocrats UCITS ETF Dist**

The objective of the Fund is to track the US equity market performance of certain high dividend-yielding equity securities. These are stocks that have grown their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.

**7) IUKD: iShares UK Dividend UCITS ETF GBP (Dist)**

This ETF seeks to track the performance of an index composed of 50 stocks with leading dividend yields from UK listed companies.

**8) HDLG: Invesco S&P 500 High Div Low Vlty UCITS ETF Dist**

This ETF aims to provide investors with a broad exposure to US companies that historically have provided high dividend yields with lower volatility. This is a conservative, risk-averse dividend fund.

**9) FUSD: Fidelity US Quality Income UCITS ETF Inc USD**

This ETF tracks high quality companies from the US, which offer high dividend yields. It offers strong growth potential and lower yield than other options.

The above investments are some ideas for European investments scratching their heads at where to go with no SCHD to select. I believe that these represent a cross-section of popular dividend funds among Europeans and offer diversification across the UK, Europe and USA as well as some global exposure.

There are thousands of ETFs out there and it can be daunting to new investors. I hope that this post goes someway to separate the wheat from the chaff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kcl40u/for_info_here_are_a_selection_of_dividend_paying/,2025-05-01 22:09:23,Reddit

I'm getting ready to retire in a few years and I'm looking for somewhere to park my cash until the date arrives. I have about 2.5 years of expenses saved in TFLO and USFR but since I'm still employed, I get hit with an additional 3.8% tax for 'Net Investment Income' on top of my federal+state taxes.  
Is there an alternative to these ETF's that do not pay a interests and just appreciates?  
I've been looking for a few months and wither the fund value varies greatly, it pays like all the other, or I just don't understand it (I've seen the zero coupon t-bills but my brain just doesn't get it.)

investing,Moving wife's high fee funds,"My wife (almost 56) has a T. Rowe rollover IRA(PRJIX, TRAIX, PRZIX) that my late brother helped her set up starting about 25 years ago. It has done well for her over time, with about an 8.5% average return even with the recent market turmoil. A total of about $95k invested on 2 occasions($30k in 1999, $65k in 2010) has turned into $500k+ with no additional contributions. All growth has been from DRIP and capital gains. I honestly never really knew about fund fees until more recently and realized hers were very high. I also noticed that the funds had peaked at over $600k 4 years ago and this opened my eyes that something had really dragged it down. With the recent market volatility, we have talked about getting away from this aggressive(83/17) and high fee portfolio and moving to a more conservative lower fee position that balances capital preservation and growth. Contributions to it will be sporadic depending on how her business is. We'd like to keep it simple and stay with TRP to avoid any tax implications but are hesitating with the right funds to choose. The lower cost typical Bogle-esque 3 fund options are POMIX, PIEQX, and PBDIX but I wondered about PREIX as part of the allocation instead of POMIX. I'm thinking along the lines of a 50% US/20% Int/30% Bond allocation. In the future, I also thought about a dividend weighted fund such as PRDGX for income, but those fees are higher. For context, we likely might not need to touch this for a long time, if at all because of our financial position. I (59) am retiring in 2 months with $4k/month pension and a little over $1m in my union surety fund. I will be taking SS at 62 at about $2700/month.

I am an investment firm. Client A is my preferred client, dedicates a lot of money, contributes more in fees, refers their rich friends. Client B is my typical client, retiree, retail investor, passive and/or lower income. 

Monday morning: 
Client A has a lot to unload, is looking to move capital out of equities and into something less volatile. 

Client B is ready to make their weekly/monthly payroll investment. 

Shares of XYZ are trading at $100. Client A wants to sell 50, client B wants to buy 100. Whose order gets processed first? Client B, which causes the price to rise. Client B pays more as Client A’s shares are withheld. Then once Client B is filled and the market is moved up Client A’s shares are sold. Giving Client A a better price and Client B a worse price. Because Client A is the preferred client.

investing,Am I being irrational with my allocation ?,"I'm 25 years old and started investing about 4–5 months ago. I have a stable income and live with my parents, which allows me to save and invest around $800–$1,000 per month.

Here's how I currently allocate each deposit:

* **50%** goes into SPY
* **30%** into specific companies I screen and have good rationale on (I work as an equity analyst) 
* **20%** into call options with expiries of one month or longer

I’m fully aware that options trading is risky, and my track record currently is around 50/50. I’ve been criticized for having such a large allocation (20%) in options, with colleagues and friends telling me I should just increase my S&P allocation instead of ""gambling.""

But here’s my thought process: I know I still have a lot to learn, and I believe the best way to understand options is through actual trading. I feel like because I am 25 and have a stable income, I can bear some risk. However, I am still new to this, and I believe there are people in this subreddit that have been in my shoes at some point in their life and have a solid advice on the matter.

Like I said I’m considering lowering SWLGX to 30% and using that 5% to buy BRK/B. I can buy fractional shares of it through Schwab.

investing,Equity Valuations - Trying to make the things easier,"If you are the one, always scared of the big terms like equity valuations this article may help you. I will take you through one analogy .



 Just imagine you are in the final year of your college and placement season is on, your friend and you are not allowed to sit in placements, so you decided to make some money other way round. Your friend and you decided to bet that who’s going to do better in life in next 10 years among all the students sitting for placements. Whom are you going to bet on? What would be your criteria? Your answer perhaps may be one of the following.

1.      The students who are the toppers in class  
2.      The students who have great achievements in extracurricular  
3.      If lucky you will find someone who satisfies both qualities

So basically, you chose blue chips of the class, based on their past performance. Did it cross your mind of choosing someone who doesn’t fit in the above-mentioned criterion, maybe not. If all your bets have the same reward associated (Doesn’t matter which student, you chose you will get the same money). But what if your friend is intelligent like you and every student is already ranked on the basis of above 3 qualities (Higher the rank better the student) and you get the highest money for betting on the lowest ranked student and vice versa.

Here the real problem of the financial world starts, now your focus shifts to choose a student who can give you the max. on your bet but with the risk that you can manage or maybe you would like to distribute your bets among multiple students, so ultimately you would not lose money.

The stock market works in the same way if everyone knows you are a performer its already priced in and if you have never performed in past, you will not get high valuations, but the biggest money will be made on someone who has not performed in the past and suddenly he/she starts performing.

investing,The Where Part of Oil Quotes,"This is a hard question to formulate. Where is the oil in its production chain that corresponds to the quotes we see online? 

Are oil quotes the price of the oil coming out of the wellhead? Is it the price of the oil coming out of a particular field? Is it the price of the oil at some tank farm? Is it after oil gets segregated by grade? 

Oil is fungible so the where part doesn't really matter with respect to Wyoming or Texas. But then again, maybe it does. There are sure to be slight differences in price between geographic locations.

The oil obviously doesn't go to Chicago behind some trader's desk in the pit.

Lots of links online about oil quotes but I couldn't find details like this.

It seems to me that each stage adds some value and some expense to oil. 

Hopefully you see what I'm getting at when I ask, where is the oil quoted?

I purchased Crowdstrike at $170 a share and now have around $50K in Crowdstrike shares.

Considering how fast Crowdstrike slipped with the tariff situation as well as with the whole outage fiasco last year makes me worried that it’s a vulnerable stock, especially because I expect investors to focus on value based stocks if the U.S. heads into a recession.

To me this looks like a giant put? Isn’t it?

Some relevant extracted sentences :

- In a time of geopolitical volatility, we are committed to providing digital stability.

- To further cement the nexus between Microsoft and Europe, going forward our European datacenter operations and their boards will be overseen by a European board of directors that consists exclusively of European nationals and operates under European law.

- In the unlikely event we are ever ordered by any government anywhere in the world to suspend or cease cloud operations in Europe, we are committing that Microsoft will promptly and vigorously contest such a measure using all legal avenues available, including by pursuing litigation in court.

wallstreetbets,PLTR: The Most Overvalued Stock in History,"While everyone’s focused on Nvidia as the most overvalued stock of this cycle, the real bubble is Palantir.

Palantir is sitting at a price to sales ratio of 100, making it the most expensive large cap stock ever on a revenue basis. At an almost $300 billion market cap with 34% revenue growth and less than $3B in sales for all of 2024, the stock’s valuation is completely disconnected from its fundamentals.

Here's a table of the most overvalued large cap stocks I could find throughout history, sorted by date of the peak P/S ratio along with P/E a year later and change in revenue, EPS, and share price in the year following the peak valuation (I worked all weekend on this unfortunately):

https://preview.redd.it/s3lyvzswauye1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5dd317b75dac68b696e235c17a97437175c9c33

**Nvidia**

Nvidia’s valuation was insane and the growth was even crazier. That was a once in lifetime growth story, and PLTR is somehow priced much higher.

**Tesla**

Tesla’s 1,400 P/E in 2021 looks insane but EPS exploded the next year and the valuation normalized. Palantir doesn’t have anywhere close to that growth coming.

**Cisco**

Cisco is a better comparison. It crashed over 80% during the dotcom bubble pop and never returned to those levels. PLTR is more expensive with weaker growth and is somehow projected for less revenue growth than Cisco saw throughout that 80% stock decline.

**Zoom**

The closest comparison is Zoom, which peaked with a P/S of 106 in late 2020. Zoom went on to grow revenue at 170% and EPS at 319% over the next year. Despite that insane growth (much higher than what Palantir is projected to do), the stock still dropped 45% in that time, then bottomed nearly 90% from its highs. Palantir is trading at a similar valuation with significantly less growth. 2021 was also a euphoric market year, while we’re at the beginning of a market-wide bubble pop.

Palantir is more expensive than Zoom at its peak valuation (at the beginning of one of the most euphoric market periods we’ve ever seen) with much less projected growth. It is also trading far above Nvidia’s peak multiples despite Nvidia growing more than 6x faster on revenue and 4x faster on EPS.

**Conspiracies**

Palantir’s surge is driven by AI hype and retail euphoria. I saw bulls on Twitter calling for the stock to 10x in five years which is ridiculous. Some of the hype is also based on a weird conspiracy that Trump is going to pump it or Peter Thiel is going to enslave us all with AI. I have no idea where that comes from and I’m 99% sure that everyone blindly parroting these claims has no idea what Palantir actually does either.

Every stock in the table above showed strong revenue and earnings growth in the 12 months after their peak valuation. That didn’t stop the crashes. Valuations eventually matter. Palantir will keep growing but not anywhere near fast enough to justify this kind of multiple.

tl;dr: Palantir is talked about like the next Nvidia, but it’s the next Cisco or Zoom. I have no idea how this stock is above $20 a share.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kew2vw/pltr_the_most_overvalued_stock_in_history/,2025-05-04 22:20:04,Reddit

my rationale here might make me sound like a pine cone, but hear me out .

Today was rather a historic day, first time in over 20 years that the market had 9 consecutive green days. 

Now I understand that we are in uptrend/recovery and had good earnings and good numbers this week which justifies the  uptrend however one would assume a pullback is imminent. 


Next week being the fed meeting I personally don’t think we being any rate cuts. On top of that tariff deals seem vague. 

I have puts for Wednesday and Friday  (bought at market close) and I feel like holding them is somewhat justified. 

All else being equal the probability of market being up or down 1/2 or 50% . Monday being the 10th consecutive green day would be  1/1024 or 0.097% chance.

wallstreetbets,EU Targets €100 Billion of US Goods With Tariffs If Talks Fail,"The European Union plans to hit about €100 billion ($113 billion) in US goods with additional tariffs in the event ongoing trade talks fail to yield a satisfactory result for the bloc, according to people familiar with the matter.

The proposed retaliatory measures will be shared with member states as early as Wednesday and consultations will last for a month before the list is finalized, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans are private. The list could change in that time. Separately, the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm that handles trade matters, is expected to share a paper with the US this week to try to kickstart the negotiations, Bloomberg reported earlier.

Proposals from the EU are expected to include lowering trade and non-tariff barriers and boosting investments in the US.

Negotiations between the EU and US, which began in earnest last month, have made scant progress and the expectation is that the bulk of the American tariffs will remain in place. The EU said on Tuesday that Trump's ongoing trade investigations will boost the amount of the bloc's goods facing tariffs to €549 billion.

A commission spokesperson declined to comment.

The new EU counter-measure list will come on top of the €21 billion of US goods already targeted by EU levies in response to Trump’s 25% duty on steel and aluminum exports. The EU agreed earlier this month to delay for 90 days the implementation of those measures after the US lowered his so-called reciprocal rate on most EU exports to 10% from 20% while the negotiations are taking place.

Trump has also imposed a 25% duty on cars as well as some car parts and has initiated investigations that could result in duties on the imports of lumber, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, critical minerals and trucks.

The commission has said all options are on the table in response to Trump’s levies and future measures could target services and restrict exports, Bloomberg previously reported.

wallstreetbets,This Saturday might actually give investors a 💡when Buffet tells everyone that they SOLD MORE.,"Speculation is… 

Berkshire Hathaway may continue to reduce its stock positions at the upcoming shareholder meeting on May 3, 2025.

1. Significant Stock Sales: In 2024, Berkshire sold approximately $133.2 billion in stocks, including reductions in major holdings like Apple, Bank of America, and Citigroup. 

2. Record Cash Reserves: Berkshire's cash reserves have surpassed $300 billion, indicating a cautious approach to new investments amid market uncertainties. 

3. Defensive Strategy Amid Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Persistent inflation risks, uncertainty around interest rate policy, trade wars, and geopolitical instability have led Berkshire to adopt a more defensive posture.

Given these factors, it's plausible that Berkshire Hathaway will continue to pare down its stock positions, especially in overvalued sectors. The company's substantial cash holdings position it well to capitalize on future market opportunities.

And then 💥. Realization to the market and might actually show how bad this economy has gotten.

wallstreetbets,Treasury yields rising is a terrible sign and not similar to Covid recovery,"GDP/stocks down while yields go up is not the same as when it happens from Covid recovery. It’s much worse.

Keep seeing the sentiment that yields up and stock market down is just a recent trend and doesn’t mean anything negative. 

That is not the case here.  If the sentiment was overwhelmingly positive that the economy was going to suddenly do a lot better after a downturn then perhaps yield would go up. During recovery from COVID, there was stimulus and optimism  of economy recovering. During the offset of COVID itself yields went down and stocks up because there was still trust in the US dollar and that allowed further tools for economic recovery. 


There is NO positive reason yields would be going up right now. These are caused by geopolitical tensions. Countries are and we have reports of this dumping us bonds. There is also less trust in the us bond. Also fear of debt problems. While covid was recovering this was still optimistic as economy was going towards steady recovery.  Stagflation from tariffs is not a meme and something economists kept warning about. If government can’t have the flexibility to cut inflation they can’t use deficit to stimulate the economy.

This is a dangerous sign. I’d be cautious to alarmed right now 



Edit: Obviously don't use this to influence any stock market decisions. This moreso a warning sign in regards to what may end up happening if there isn't a quick reverse. These warning signs would have the heavier impact not be felt until further down the line and hard to know how much damage/permanent damage until 2nd quarter.

wallstreetbets,DoorDash to buy UK’s Deliveroo for $3.9 billion,"DoorDash Inc. has agreed to buy UK-based food-delivery platform Deliveroo Plc for an equity value of £2.9 billion ($3.9 billion), as the US company targets smaller providers in a push into more overseas markets. 

DoorDash has offered 180 pence in cash for each Deliveroo share, the company said in a statement on Tuesday, confirming the terms of an offer announced on April 25. That’s a 29% premium to Deliveroo’s closing share price on April 24. 

DoorDash, which owns two-thirds of the restaurant delivery market in the US, has been looking to strengthen its position abroad. For DoorDash, acquiring Deliveroo would help it access the UK and urban areas in Europe. The proposal is the latest example of consolidation in the food delivery industry, after Prosus NV in February agreed to buy Amsterdam’s Just Eat Takeaway.com NV.

wallstreetbets,"-$52K Unrealized. Jumped into calls too early.Posting it all — mistakes, lessons, next steps.","Tried to catch the bounce too early after the recent flush, rotated into calls on NVDA, SPY, TSLA, and MSTR — and it’s currently not playing out.

📉 Unrealized P/L so far: -$52k

What went wrong:

Got too aggressive too fast.

Saw some bullish setups forming and rushed in without real confirmation.

Bought the dip thinking we’d get a snapback rally — but the chop is brutal and the trend isn’t reversing (yet).

What I’m learning:

Size control matters more than ever in this market.

“Obvious reversals” rarely are.

No matter how strong the setup feels, entries still need to be timed with discipline.

What’s next:

I’m not exiting yet — there’s still time premium, especially on SPY and MSTR.

I know this sub is filled with monster green days and big wins — which is great — but here’s a dose of the other side.      This isn’t the end of the world, but it is a gut check.

Posting to stay accountable and to remind myself (and maybe others) that every play teaches something, if you’re honest enough to face it.

Will update if anything changes.      Open to thoughts if anyone’s riding similar setups or sees a different angle.",https://i.redd.it/fffyxo4k4zye1.png,2025-05-05 14:32:04,Reddit

wallstreetbets,Nasdaq Plan Will Bring Zero-Day Option Boom Closer to Single Stocks,"This summary is for people that can't/won't read the article:

1. **Nasdaq's Proposal**: Nasdaq plans to expand weekly expirations for options on select stocks to include Mondays and Wednesdays in addition to Fridays. This change, pending SEC approval, is expected to start trading by the first half of 2026.
2. **Expanding 0DTE Options**: This move aims to bring the popular zero-day trading boom—currently focused on major indexes like the S&P 500—to individual stocks. It will allow investors to better manage portfolios and risks.
3. **Criteria for Stocks**: Only stocks with a minimum market capitalization of $700 billion and ETFs with a net asset value above $50 billion will qualify for these additional expirations. Companies like Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and others meet these criteria.
4. **Challenges with Single-Stock Options**: Unlike index options, single-stock options are typically physically settled, adding risks for retail traders. Nasdaq proposes avoiding expirations coinciding with company earnings to reduce such risks.
5. **Market Potential**: While untested, demand for single-stock 0DTE options is expected to be high, based on strong trading volumes for single-stock options and investor enthusiasm.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-01/nasdaq-plan-will-bring-0dte-boom-a-step-closer-to-single-stocks,2025-05-01 14:11:23,Reddit
